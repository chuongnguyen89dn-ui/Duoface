Changes: first-party owner-scoped YouTube main-scene remote orientation candidate from Native12 gold portrait=1 and OmniCar original interfaceOrientation transaction, plus V7 read-only CarPlayApp native FBScene Google Maps identity monitor. `DFSceneLifecycle.m` .83 crash mitigation and 0.50 iPhone-app scale unchanged; rejected .85 map zoom must not return.

**IMPORTANT:** Build and SHA verification are NOT proof YouTube rotation is corrected on iPhone or that native Google Maps is displayed simultaneously in a DuoFace split pane. Native Maps actual scene still unproven after the CarPlay Dashboard switches to DuoFace, so **native Maps split is NOT IMPLEMENTED**. Do not pretend scene reparent or clone is safe. Device QA and separate native scene lifecycle evidence remain required. Do not auto-deploy or mark Sileo published solely from build. Keep .83/.84 immutable rollback.
